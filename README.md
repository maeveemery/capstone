# capstone
This repository holds all of the documents from my most recent corporate sponsored capstone project, which included dealing with data from an energy company from wind turbines.
This project was twofold- Predict costly electrical errors, and find the conditions in which the wind turbines are operating below optimal power output. 
For the former, this included the attached R scripts to impute the data and clean it, and then a Knn model to predict when Balance of Plant errors happen in real time, with a two hour lag (two hours in the future) and in the upcoming 24 hours. 
The latter was created through mathematical modeling, which is outlined in the attached presentation.
